# How to contribute

We love code contributions, documentation updates and everything else! Thank you for all your efforts. We do have some expectations though:

- All code must have supporting tests
- New functionality or changes in functionality should be documented
- Be sure to point out any breaking changes
- Tell us why you think your contribution will improve the package

Again, thank you for all your hard work. Keep at it!
